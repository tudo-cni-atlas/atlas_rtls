# atlas_rtls

## Overview

This is the ATLAS Real-Time Localization System (RTLS). ATLAS is based on ultra-wideband using the time-difference of arrival (TDOA) topology in which the mobile nodes transmit periodically and the infrastructure-based nodes are mostly passive.

The atlas_rtls package has been tested under [ROS] Kinetic and Ubuntu 18.04. This is research code, expect that it changes often and any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.


## Installation

### Building from Source

#### Dependencies

- [Robot Operating System (ROS)](http://wiki.ros.org) (middleware for robotics),
- [Eigen] (linear algebra library)

		sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev


#### Building

To build from source, clone the latest version from this repository into your catkin workspace and compile the package using

	cd catkin_workspace/src
	git clone https://github.com/tudo-cni-atlas/atlas_rtls.git
	cd ../
	catkin_make -j1


## Usage

Due to the numerous configuration files that are required to run the ATLAS RTLS, a seperate deployment-specific config repository is needed. An example is provided here:
[Example config and raw data](https://github.com/celidon-project/atlas_config_celidon)


The firmware for the nodes will be provided upon completion of academic review.


## Nodes

### atlas_node_bridge

Connects an anchor node through the serial protocol interface.

### atlas_core

Collects the TOA messages from multiple node bridges and assembles samples.

### atlas_loc

Calculates position results from the sample messages of the atlas core.

### atlas_fast

Provides scheduling for ATLAS FaST enabled mobile tags.

### atlas_viz

Enables visualization of the anchor nodes within [rviz].
